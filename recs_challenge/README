(Last updated 19/01/2015)

Please feel free to use this solution as a starting point to improve upon or build your own entirely.
We strongly encourage you to try different approaches for generating your recommendations - this solution is
provided to give you some boilerplate code to enable you to focus on creating your algorithms.

*** How To Use ***

To run the scripts and generate the recommendations, first download the two data sets from the challenge website.
Place these files (train.csv and customers_to_predict.csv) inside the 'given' directory. From the directory
containing the makefile, invoke the command:

make clean all

This may take a minute or two to execute. Once it's finished, the file overall_output.csv will contain the
final recommendations in the correct format to upload to the challenge website.

Good luck and have fun!
